Types of DS:

    1) Linear Data Structure: A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear (sequential) order. 
        Examples: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List.
        (It can be also mentioned as if each element has only one successor and predecessor.)

    2) Non Linear Data Structure: A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear (sequential) order. There is no linear arrangement of the elements.

    The Classification can be made on another context: 

    a) Static Data Structure: In these type of data structures, the memory is allocated at compile time. Therefore, maximum size is fixed.
    b) Dynamic Data Structure: In these type of data structures, the memory is allocated at run time. Therefore, maximum size is flexible.
